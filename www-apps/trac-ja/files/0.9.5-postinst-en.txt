Install Instructions
====================

To complete the install, create your first Trac environment by running this command:

	trac-admin /var/lib/trac/<project-name> initenv

For security, trac relies on the webserver for authentication. The following command
creates a password database for Basic Authentication with Apache 2: 

	htpasswd2 -c /etc/apache2/trac.htpasswd <user-name>

Please adjust for the webserver of your choice, and refer to your webserver's
documentation.

Now, all you need to do is to configure your webserver. The following is a configuration
example for CGI and Apache:

	<Location "/cgi-bin/trac.cgi">
		SetEnv TRAC_ENV "/var/lib/trac/<project-name>"
	</Location>
	<Location "/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/login">
		AuthType Basic
		AuthName "trac"
		AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/trac.htpasswd
		Require valid-user
	</Location>

Again, please adjust for the webserver of your choice.

Fast-CGI users: you have to emerge and configure your Fast-CGI engine separately.

You can also use Trac without having to install a webserver. See
http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/TracStandalone to know more.

Don't forget to update the configuration file! It is located at
/var/lib/trac/<project-name>/conf/trac.ini. See its reference at
http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/TracIni.

More information (multiple projects setup, installation with Apache 2's mod_python,
lighttpd...) can be found on the Trac wiki:

Upgrade Instructions
====================

If you are upgrading from a previous Trac version, please follow the
instructions here:

	http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/TracUpgrade

Trac 0.9.x now uses sqlite-3 instead of sqlite-2. If you were using Trac 0.8.x or below,
you have to upgrade your database files or else you won't be able to use Trac. You can
issue the following commands, for each environment you have:

	mv /var/lib/trac/<project-name>/db/trac.db /var/lib/trac/<project-name>/db/trac2.db
	sqlite /var/lib/trac/<project-name>/db/trac2.db .dump | sqlite3 /var/lib/trac/<project-name>/db/trac.db
	trac-admin /var/lib/trac/<project-name> upgrade
	trac-admin /var/lib/trac/<project-name> resync
	trac-admin /var/lib/trac/<project-name> wiki upgrade

And review the trac.ini configuration file.
